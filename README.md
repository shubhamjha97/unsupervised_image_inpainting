# Unsupervised Image Inpainting

This is the code accompanying our project on image inpainting done as part of the Final Project for Computer Vision Course (CSCI-GA 2271) at New York University.


## How to run

Each sub folder has a README to guide you to run the necessary code.


## Results

Our modified CoModGAN has the following results on ImageNet, WikiArt, Places and FFHQ dataset:
